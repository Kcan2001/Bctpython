              The purpose of travel is to discover new things about yourself, meet new friends,
              and see the unknown. Most solo travelers find themselves frustrated with their
              friends doing the same things over and over... Blackcrow is a great way to avoid
              the fear of traveling alone, without spending a fortune. So while you may sign up
              alone, you won't be for long...

              <br><br>Each trip is shared in advance on Facebook giving you a chance to see everyone
              who's going. (Your guide will also be a part of the event group), chat a bit, and share
              the things you're excited about!
