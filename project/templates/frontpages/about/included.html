                        The purpose of travel is to discover new things about yourself, meet new friends,
                        and see the unknown. Most solo travelers find themselves frustrated with their
                        friends doing the same things over and over... Blackcrow is a great way to avoid
                        the fear of traveling alone, without spending a fortune. So while you may sign up
                        alone, you won't be for long...

                        <br><br>Each trip is shared in advance on Facebook giving you a chance to see everyone

                        the things you're excited about!
